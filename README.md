# nine-mens-morris

Nine men's morris, played through the command-line interface.

During the initial phase, players are asked to input coordinates of a position on which to place their piece, e.g. "a7".
During the second phase, players are asked to input the coordinates of two positions, in order to move a piece from the first to the second, e.g. "a7a4"

On every turn, the board is printed to the console with the positions marked as either empty (·), occupied by a white piece (○), or occupied by a black piece (●).
